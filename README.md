This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

Install the dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Details
- I pushed the .env file to make evaluating the test easier

I used the free gpt-4.1-mini version to generate the text, but this version does not allow reading text from external links.

To read external links with an OpenAI Pro key, change the line "gpt-4.1-mini" to "gpt-5.2" in the file /home/pedro/Documentos/dakota-test/app/api/salary/route.ts
